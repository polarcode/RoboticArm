\chapter{Import .stl-files into Matlab/Octave}
The .stl-files created by the OpenSCAD software have to be imported into Matlab/Octave. We found a function written by Don Riley on the mathworks forum which did exactly what we needed.
You can give the path to your .stl-file as a parameter and it returns matrix with homogeneous coordinates of every point in the .stl-file.
This matlab/octave function is also included in this project and it's name is: loadCAD.m.
